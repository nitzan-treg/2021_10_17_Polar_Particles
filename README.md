#  Polar Particles
This is an experiment with particles and polar coordinates, I tried to create an interesting animation by animating the U, V or Radius compounents of the Polar Coordinates

the particles were created with a particle simulation with pop force and axis force to make them spin around the Y axis.

Afterward I would normalize the Position attribute, convert it to polar cordiantes, add the world and polar position togerher, while animating the world position.
