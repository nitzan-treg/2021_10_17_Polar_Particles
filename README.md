#  Polar Trail
This is an experiment with curves and polar coordinates, I tried to create an interesting animation by animating the U, V or Radius compounents of the Polar Coordinates

The curves were created in a for() loop inside Point VOP, in every loop each point would sample a Curl noise, add it to its current position and add a new point in said position.

Afterward I would normalize the Position attribute, convert it to polar cordiantes, add the world and polar position togerher, while animating the world position.
